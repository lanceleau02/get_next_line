<p>Description:</p>

> Write a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.

<h2>‚úîÔ∏è Project's requirements</h2>

- Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your `get_next_line()` function should let
you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, **one line at a time**.
- Your function should return the line that was read. If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return `NULL`.
- Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when
reading from the standard input.
- **Please note** that the returned line should include the terminating `\n` character,
except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a `\n` character.
- Your header file `get_next_line.h` must at least contain the prototype of the
`get_next_line()` function.
- Add all the helper functions you need in the `get_next_line_utils.c` file.
- Because you will have to read files in `get_next_line()`, add this option to your compiler call: `-D BUFFER_SIZE=n`. It will define the buffer size for `read()`. The buffer size value will be modified by your peer-evaluators and the Moulinette in order to test your code.
- You will compile your code as follows (a buffer size of 42 is used as an example): <br>`cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c`
- We consider that `get_next_line()` has an undefined behavior if the file pointed to by the file descriptor changed since the last call whereas `read()` didn‚Äôt reach the end of file.
- We also consider that `get_next_line()` has an undefined behavior when reading a binary file. However, you can implement a logical way to handle this behavior if you want to.
- You are not allowed to use your `libft` in this project.
- `lseek()` is forbidden.
- Global variables are forbidden.
