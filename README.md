# **get_next_line**

**Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious.**

</div>

## Features

- Reads files or input line by line.
- Handles multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
- Adapts to a user-defined `BUFFER_SIZE`.
- Manages memory dynamically for arbitrary line lengths.
- Detects and handles end-of-file properly.
- Supports any valid file descriptor (files, stdin, sockets).
- Provides a simple function: `char *get_next_line(int fd);`.
